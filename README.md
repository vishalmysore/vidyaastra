## Database Schema

The project uses the following graph model:
- Players (nodes) with properties: name, country, role, jerseyNumber
- Teams (nodes) with properties: name, country
- Matches (nodes) with properties: venue, matchDate, matchType, result
- Relationships:
  - PLAYS_FOR: Player ‚Üí Team
  - PLAYED_MATCH: Team ‚Üí Match
  - WINNER: Match ‚Üí Team
  - SCORED_IN: Player ‚Üí Match (with performance statistics)

## Configuration

1. Set up environment variables for Neo4j Aura connection:

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
$env:NEO4J_PASSWORD="your-neo4j-password"
```

```bash
# Linux/macOS
export NEO4J_PASSWORD="your-neo4j-password"
```

The application.properties already contains the connection details for:
- URI: neo4j+s://bb3147a9.databases.neo4j.io
- Username: neo4j
- Database: neo4j

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

1. Set up environment variables for Neo4j Aura connection:

```powershell
# Windows Command Prompt
set NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-neo4j-password

# Windows PowerShell
$env:NEO4J_PASSWORD="your-neo4j-password"
```

```bash
# Linux/macOS
export NEO4J_PASSWORD="your-neo4j-password"
```

The application.properties already contains the connection details for:
- URI: neo4j+s://bb3147a9.databases.neo4j.io
- Username: neo4j
- Database: neo4j

### Build the Project

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Running Individual Modules

Each module can be run independently by specifying the active profile. Use the `-Dspring.profiles.active=` parameter:

**Cricket Module:**
```cmd
set NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-neo4j-password
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=cricket
```

**Healthcare Module (HC):**
```cmd
set NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-neo4j-password
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=hc
```

**Yoga Module:**
```cmd
set NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-neo4j-password
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=yoga
```

**Supermarket Module (Supermart):**
```cmd
set NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-neo4j-password
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=supermart
```

**Fraud Detection Module (FD):**
```cmd
set NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-neo4j-password
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=fd
```

For Linux/macOS, use `export` instead of `set`.

### Batch Scripts (Windows)

You can create batch files for quick execution. For example, `run-hc.bat`:

```batch
@echo off
set NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-neo4j-password
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=hc
pause
```

Then simply run:
```cmd
run-hc.bat
```

The application will:
- Connect to Neo4j database
- Create the graph schema
- Load sample cricket match data (through CricketDataLoader)

## Available Queries

The application supports various queries through repository interfaces:

### Player Queries
- Find players by team
- Find players by country
- Find players who won Man of the Match

### Team Queries
- Find teams by number of wins
- Find teams by matches played
- Find team by name

### Match Queries
- Find matches by type (T20, ODI, Test)
- Find matches by venue
- Find matches won by a specific team
- Find matches between dates

## Sample Data

The application includes a data loader (`CricketDataLoader.java`) that populates the database with sample data including:
- Teams (India, Australia)
- Players (Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Steve Smith, Pat Cummins)
- A sample match between India and Australia

## Testing

To run the tests:
```bash
mvn test
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Connection Issues**
   - Verify your Neo4j password is correctly set in environment variables
   - Check if the Neo4j Aura instance is running
   - Verify network connectivity to Neo4j Aura

2. **Build Issues**
   - Ensure Java 17 is installed and JAVA_HOME is properly set
   - Clear Maven cache if needed: `mvn clean`
