## 📚 Neo4j Cypher Queries

### Cricket Module Examples

**1️⃣ List all teams and their players**
```cypher
MATCH (t:Team)<-[r:PLAYS_FOR]-(p:Player)
RETURN t.name, collect(p.name) AS Players;
```

**2️⃣ Teams ranked by wins**
```cypher
MATCH (m:Match)-[:WINNER]->(t:Team)
RETURN t.name AS Team, count(m) AS Wins
ORDER BY Wins DESC;
```

**3️⃣ Players by role**
```cypher
MATCH (p:Player)
RETURN p.role, collect(p.name) AS Players;
```

**4️⃣ Matches between specific teams**
```cypher
MATCH (m:Match)-[:TEAM_1|TEAM_2]->(t:Team {name: "India"})
RETURN m.matchDate, m.venue, m.result;
```

### Fraud Detection Examples

**1️⃣ Find fraud rings (cycles)**
```cypher
MATCH (n)-[r*]->(n)
WHERE length(r) > 1
RETURN n, r;
```

**2️⃣ High-risk transactions**
```cypher
MATCH (f:FraudType)-[:HAS_INDICATOR]->(i:Indicator {riskScore: "High"})
RETURN f.name, i.pattern;
```

**3️⃣ Detection method effectiveness**
```cypher
MATCH (d:DetectionMethod)-[:DETECTS]->(f:FraudType)
RETURN d.name, d.accuracy, count(f) AS FraudTypesDetected
ORDER BY d.accuracy DESC;
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### application.properties
```properties
spring.neo4j.uri=neo4j+s://your-instance.databases.neo4j.io
spring.neo4j.authentication.username=neo4j
spring.neo4j.authentication.password=${NEO4J_PASSWORD}
spring.neo4j.database=neo4j
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run the complete test suite:
```bash
mvn test
```

Test specific module:
```bash
mvn test -Dtest=CricketServiceTest
mvn test -Dtest=HealthcareServiceTest
mvn test -Dtest=CycleDetectionServiceTest
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Neo4j Connection Failed** | Verify NEO4J_PASSWORD is set and Neo4j instance is running |
| **Build Fails** | Clear cache: `mvn clean`, verify Java 17+, check internet connection |
| **Graph Not Displaying** | Check browser console for errors, verify all node references exist |
| **Slow Queries** | Add indexes to frequently queried properties in Neo4j |

---

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Neo4j Best Practices
```cypher
-- Create indexes for frequently queried properties
CREATE INDEX ON :Player(name);
CREATE INDEX ON :Team(name);
CREATE INDEX ON :Disease(name);

-- Use EXPLAIN to analyze query performance
EXPLAIN MATCH (p:Player)-[:PLAYS_FOR]->(t:Team) RETURN p, t;
```
