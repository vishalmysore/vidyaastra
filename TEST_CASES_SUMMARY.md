## Testing Approach

### Framework & Tools
- **Framework**: JUnit 5 (Jupiter)
- **Mocking**: Mockito
- **Annotations**: `@DisplayName` for descriptive test names

### Test Structure
Each test class follows this pattern:
```java
1. Mock Setup (@Mock)
2. Service Injection (@InjectMocks)
3. Test Object Initialization (@BeforeEach)
4. Test Methods with Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
5. Mockito.verify() for interaction verification
```

### Coverage Areas
- ✅ Create operations
- ✅ Read/Retrieve operations
- ✅ Update operations
- ✅ Delete operations
- ✅ Search/Filter operations
- ✅ Empty data scenarios
- ✅ Not found scenarios
- ✅ Data validation

---

## How to Run Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
mvn test
```

### Run Tests for Specific Module
```bash
# Cricket Tests
mvn test -Dtest=vishal.mysore.cricket.service.*

# Supermarket Tests
mvn test -Dtest=vishal.mysore.supermart.service.*

# Yoga Tests
mvn test -Dtest=vishal.mysore.yoga.service.*

# Fraud Detection Tests
mvn test -Dtest=vishal.mysore.fd.service.*

# Healthcare Tests
mvn test -Dtest=vishal.mysore.hc.service.*
```

### Run Specific Test Class
```bash
mvn test -Dtest=PlayerServiceTest
mvn test -Dtest=ProductServiceTest
mvn test -Dtest=YogaPracticeServiceTest
```

### Run with Coverage Report
```bash
mvn clean test jacoco:report
```

## Key Features of Test Suite

1. **No Source Code Modifications**: All tests created without changing any production code
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover CRUD operations and edge cases
3. **Mocking**: All external dependencies mocked using Mockito
4. **Descriptive Names**: Each test has a clear, self-documenting name using `@DisplayName`
5. **Proper Setup**: Each test class has proper initialization in `@BeforeEach`
6. **Assertions**: Uses JUnit 5 assertions (assertNotNull, assertEquals, assertTrue, etc.)
7. **Verification**: Mockito verify() used to ensure methods are called correct number of times
8. **Edge Cases**: Tests include empty data, null values, and error scenarios

---

## Test Patterns Used

### Happy Path Testing
Tests verify successful operations with valid data

### Null/Not Found Testing
Tests verify behavior when entities are not found in database

### Empty Collection Testing
Tests verify correct behavior when no entities exist

### Attribute Validation Testing
Tests verify that entity attributes are correctly set and retrieved

### Interaction Verification Testing
Tests verify that repository methods are called with correct parameters and correct number of times

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run the tests**: Execute `mvn test` to run all tests
2. **Monitor coverage**: Use JaCoCo to measure code coverage
3. **Expand tests**: Add integration tests using `@DataNeo4jTest` for actual Neo4j interactions
4. **Performance tests**: Add performance benchmarking if needed
5. **Contract tests**: Create consumer-driven contract tests if exposing APIs
